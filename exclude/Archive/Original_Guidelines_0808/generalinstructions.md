# Choosing a Protected Space

A residential protected room (MAMAD), communal protected space (MAMAK), shelter, stairwell, or an inner room – choose the protected space according to the time available to reach shelter, available protection, and your ability to reach it in time.

Upon receiving an alert for a rocket and missile attack, enter the protected space according to the time available to you to reach shelter, and wait inside for 10 minutes. This can prevent injuries resulting from rocket or missile impact, and may even save your life.

## For behavior guidelines when receiving an alert

It is essential to choose “the most protected space possible”, based on the protection available and the ability to reach it in time. To check the time to reach a shelter in your area, click [here](https://www.oref.org.il/eng/articles/info/preparing-protected-space/1200) and type in the name of your location.

## The order of priority for choosing a protected space:

1. The residential protected room (MAMAD) or communal protected space (MAMAK) are the preferred option.
2. **Shelters:**
    - An apartment building shelter – provided it can be reached within the time to reach shelter and in addition, if it can be reached by an internal stairway.
    - A public shelter (miklat) – provided that it can be reached within the time available to reach shelter.
3. **An internal stairwell - with no windows, openings, and external wall:**
    - In a building with more than three floors, which has no residential protected rooms, floor protected spaces or a public shelter – stay in a stairwell with at least two floors above it. Do not stay on the ground floor. In buildings with more than three floors, the stairwells of each floor, other than the top two floors and the ground floor, are protected.
    - In a three-story building with no residential protected rooms, floor protected spaces or a public shelter – stay in a stairwell of the middle floor. In such a building, the most protected floor is the middle (second) floor.
4. **An inner room** - if there are no residential protected rooms, floor protected spaces, a public shelter, or an internal stairwell, choose an inner room with as few external walls, windows, and openings as possible. Do not choose kitchens, bathrooms, or toilets and keep away from ceramics, porcelain, and glass that might shatter. When receiving an alert, sit in an inner corner, below the window line and not facing the door.

## The following cannot be used as protected spaces

Kitchens, toilets, and bathrooms cannot be used as protected spaces; stay away from ceramics, porcelains, and glass that may shatter.

## Important Highlights

- If there is no access to a protected room, an internal stairwell, or an inner room, lie on the ground and protect your head with your hands.
- If an alert is received while you are inside a prefabricated structure, leave the building and go into the protected space in the time available to reach shelter. If entering a protected space within the time available to reach shelter is not possible, leave the building, lie on the ground and protect your head with your hands. Read [here](https://www.oref.org.il/eng/articles/info/preparing-protected-space/1200) why it is important to lie on the ground.
- Stay away from the building entrance area because of the danger of rocket fragments and blast waves due to impact near buildings.
- Building doors should be kept open, for those who are outdoors when the alert sounds.
- For a large portion of the population, the stairwell is the most protected space available. If possible, place chairs for elderly persons.

**Remember:** Choosing a protected space according to these guidelines significantly reduces the risk of injury from rockets and fragments, and can save lives.

## Maintaining the integrity of the protected space

For the protected space to fill its role in an emergency, it must be regularly maintained and the routes leading to it must be clear, in accordance with the following highlights:

- Plan your route to the protected space in advance, make sure it is cleared of obstacles and obstructing items to prevent possible falls and injuries. Ensure that all passageways and stairwells are not blocked.
- If our protected space is the residential protected room – you must maintain its integrity and refrain from making changes that are not authorized. Read about the permitted and prohibited uses of the protected room (MAMAD), including which changes may not be made to it, and how to maintain it regularly.
- If our protected space is the common shelter - you must maintain its integrity and refrain from making changes that are not authorized. Read about how to maintain the integrity of the common shelter.
- It is advised to prepare emergency supplies and a list of contact information for emergency services, family members, and neighbors, and keep it in the protected space.
- In an emergency situation - the outer steel window and the inner glass window must be closed and locked at the beginning of the emergency situation until it ends. If a double-wing glass window is installed, it must be removed and placed outside the residential protected room.
