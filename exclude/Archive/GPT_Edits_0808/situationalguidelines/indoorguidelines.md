##  Shelter Algorithm - Indoor Contexts

1. **Determine Available Time and Space**:
   - Assess the time available to reach a safe space based on the alert.

2. **Identify Priority Shelter Options**:
   - **Priority 1: Mamad, Mamak, or Public Shelter (Miklat)**
     - If available, proceed to the nearest:
       - *Mamad* (apartment’s designated protected space)
       - *Mamak* (floor’s protected space)
       - *Mamam* (institutional safe space)
       - Public shelter (*miklat tzi'buri*)
   - **Priority 2: Inner Stairwell**
     - If no Priority 1 shelters are accessible, proceed to an inner stairwell with:
       - No windows or openings
       - No external walls
       - If the building has more than three floors, choose a stairwell with at least two floors above it.
       - If the building has less than three floors, choose the middle floor stairwell.
   - **Priority 3: Non-Protected Room in Your Home**
     - If no Priority 1 or 2 options are available, choose a non-protected room with:
       - Few outside walls (ideally none)
       - Few openings

3. **Execute Shelter Procedures**:
   - **For Priority 1 Spaces (Mamad, Mamak, or Public Shelter)**
     - Close the door by turning the handle 90 degrees.
     - Ensure both the steel window and inner glass window are closed.
   - **For Priority 2 Spaces (Inner Stairwell)**
     - Sit on the stairs, not in the floor space.
   - **For Priority 3 Spaces (Non-Protected Room)**
     - Sit in an inner corner below the window line, not facing the door.
     - Avoid kitchens, bathrooms, and toilets.
