##  Shelter Algorithm - Outdoor Contexts

1. **Determine Context and Location**:
   - Assess whether you are in a built-up area or an open area when the rocket siren goes off.

2. **Identify Shelter Options Based on Context**:
   - **In a Built-Up Area**
     - Enter a shelter or a stairwell in a nearby building.
     - Stay away from building entrances.
   - **In an Open Area**
     - Lie on the ground, adopting the appropriate safe posture (protect your head with your hands).
     - Be aware that the blast wave from an explosion can generate dangerous fragments, posing a risk to anyone standing or sitting.

3. **Execute Safety Procedures**:
   - **For Built-Up Area**
     - Find the nearest building.
     - Enter the building and proceed to a shelter or stairwell.
     - Ensure you stay away from building entrances.
   - **For Open Area**
     - Immediately lie on the ground.
     - Protect your head with your hands.
     - Stay in this position until the siren stops and it is safe to move.
