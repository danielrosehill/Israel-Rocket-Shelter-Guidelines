# Context-Based Instructions: Outdoors

If you are outdoors when a rocket siren goes off, choose your shelter according to your context.

## In A Built Up Area

If you find yourself outdoors in a built up area when a siren goes off (like a town/city) then you should:

- Enter a shelter or a stairwell in a nearby building. 
- You should stay away from building entrances.

## In An Open Area

If you find yourself outdoors and in an open area when a siren goes off, then you should:

- Lie on the ground adopting the appropriate safe posture (protecting your heads with your hands)
- In the event of a rocket impact, the blast wave from the explosion can generate dangerous fragments which are capable of injuring anybody who is standing or sitting
