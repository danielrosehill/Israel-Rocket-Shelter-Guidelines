# Context-Based Instructions: Using Private Transport

If you find yourself in a private vehicle when the siren goes off then you should:

- **Stop by the side of the road**, exit the vehicle, and enter a shelter or a stairwell of a nearby building.

  If you are unable to reach a building within the time available to reach shelter then you should:
  
  - Exit the vehicle and move away from it by the side of the road or the separation fence, lie on the ground, and protect your head with your hands.
  
  If you are not able to leave the vehicle at all (and only then) you should:

  - Stop at the the side of the road and bend beneath the window line.
