**Edited: 08/08/24**

# Choosing Between 'First Priority' Spaces

If you choice is between a *mamad*, *mamak*, shelter, stairwell or an inner room, then your choice should be determined by the time available to reach shelter, the level of protection it offers, and your ability to reach it in time.

If you receive an alert, enter the protected space and wait inside for 10 minutes.

##  The General Order Of Priority

1. The **first priority** shelters are: a  *mamad* (protected room in an apartment) or a *mamak* (protected space for a building).
2. The  **second priority** shelters are:
   1. An apartment building's shelter
   2. A public shelter (*miklat*)
3. The **third priority** sheltering space is an internal stairwall that has no windows, openings, or external walls.
    The following guidelines pertain to this space:
    1. **In a building with more than three floors**, which has no residential protected rooms, floor protected spaces or a public shelter – stay in a stairwell with at least two floors above it. Do not stay on the ground floor. In buildings with more than three floors, the stairwells of each floor, other than the top two floors and the ground floor, are protected.
    2.  **In a building with exactly three floors** and with no residential protected rooms, floor protected spaces or a public shelter – stay in a stairwell of the middle floor. In such a building, the most protected floor is the middle (second) floor.
4. The **fourth priority** shelter is an inner room and the following guidelines pertain to it:
    1.  If there are no residential protected rooms, floor protected spaces, a public shelter, or an internal stairwell, choose an inner room with as few external walls, windows, and openings as possible. Do not choose kitchens, bathrooms, or toilets and keep away from ceramics, porcelain, and glass that might shatter. When receiving an alert, sit in an inner corner, below the window line and not facing the door.
5.  The **last resort** is to lie on the ground and adopt a protective posture according to the official guidelines. 

## Not Considered 'Safe' Spaces For The Purpose Of These Guidelines

- Kitchens
- Toilets
- Bathrooms

These are the additional guidelines for sheltering indoors:

- Stay away from ceramics, porcelains, and glass that may shatter.

## Guidelines For Specific Circumstances

### Alert Sounds While In A Prefabricated Structure

  If an alert is received while you are inside a prefabricated structure, leave the building and go into the protected space in the time available to reach shelter. 

### Last Resort / No Shelter Available

If entering a protected space within the time available to reach shelter is not possible, leave the building, lie on the ground and protect your head with your hands.

## Additional Guidelines

### Avoid Building Entrances

Stay away from the building entrance area. 

This space is potentially suspectible to rocket fragments and blast waves due to impacts on nearby buildings.

### Keep Building Doors Open

  The entrance doors to buildings should be kept open for the benefit of those who may find themselves outside when the alert sounds [and need to shelter inside the building]

  ### Places Chairs In The Stairwell

For a significant portion of Israel's population, the stairwall is the most protected space available. 

Please consider placing chairs in it for the benefit of elderly residents.

## Maintaining the integrity of the protected space

For the protected space to fill its role in an emergency, it must be regularly maintained.

These are additional recommendations:

- Plan your route to the protected space in advance, make sure it is cleared of obstacles and obstructing items to prevent possible falls and injuries. Ensure that all passageways and stairwells are not blocked.
  - If your protected space is the residential protected room you are obliged to maintain its integrity and refrain from making changes unauthorized changes [to the space]
  - The Home Front Command maintains guidelines regarding legally prohibited uses for the protected room (*mamad*) and maintains guidelines for its maintenance.
  -  If your protected space is the common building shelter, you are obligated to maintain its integrity and must refrain from making unauthorised changes to it. 

## General Preparedness Recommendations

- It is recommended to maintain emergency supplies in your household
- You should also maintain contact information for your family members which may be useful for emergency services
- In the event of an emergency the outer steel window and inner glass window (of the mamad) must be closed and locked at the beginning of the emergency and until it is declared formally over. 
- If a double-wing glass window is installed, it must be removed and placed outside of the building protected room.
