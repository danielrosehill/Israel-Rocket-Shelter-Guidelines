# Context-Based Instructions: Indoors

If you are able to enter one of the following spaces within the time available to you, you should do so according to the following order of preference:

 ### Priority 1: Mamad, Mamak Or Public Shelter (Miklat)

 As a first priority proceed to whichever of these is accssible to you and closest:

- Your *mamad* (apartment's designated protected space)
- A *mamak* or *mamam* which you can access (a *mamak* is a protected space for the floor and a *mamam* is translated by Pikud Haoref as an "institutional" safe space)
- A public shelter (*miklat tzi'buri*)

If you can access one of these spaces, upon doing so, follow these instructions:

- Close the door by turning the handle 90 degrees
- Ensure that the steel window and inner glass window are both closed

### Priority 2: Inner Stairwell

If none of the first priority sheltering spaces are available to you within the time of the alert, then choose an *inner stairwell**

The guidelines are that this space should (ideally) have:

- No windows
- No openings
- No external walls

An "external wall" is a wall in the buildilng that is exposed to the outdoors.

When you reach the stairwell you should sit on the stairs and not in the floor space.

#### Additional Instructions For Choosing A Stairwell

- **If the building is more than three floors high**, you should remain on a stairwell **with at least two floors above it.**
- **If the building is less than three floors high** you should remain on the middle floor
 In a building with less than three floors â€“ stay in the middle floor.

### Priority 3: Non-Protected Room In Your Home

The last priority if you are indoors is to choose a regular room in your home (ie, not a *mamad* / protected space). Choose this option only if there are no options from the above two priorities available to you.

These are the ideal considerations that you should look for in a last resort inner room:

- The room should have as few outside walls as possible, ideally none
- It should have as few openings as possible

When inside you should:

- Sit in an inner corner below the window line and not facing the door.

Also note:

- Kitchens, bathrooms, toilets cannot be used as an inner room.
