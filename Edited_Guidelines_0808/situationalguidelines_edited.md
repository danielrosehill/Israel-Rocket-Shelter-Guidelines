# Edited Version of Guidelines

**Edited: 08/08/24**

*For the original, unedited version of these guidelines you can refer to the `Original_Guidelines_0808` folder*

## Indoors

Enter a protected space that can be reached within the time available to you and the protection around you, based on the following priorities:

- **MAMAD (residential protected room), MAMAK (communal protected space), MAMAM (institutional protected space), or a shelter** – Close the door by turning the handle 90 degrees, and ensure the external steel window and the inner glass window are closed.
- **Inner stairwell** – With no windows, openings, or external walls. Sit on the stairs, not in the floor space. In a building with more than three floors, stay on the stairwell with at least two floors above it. In a building with less than three floors, stay on the middle floor.
- **Inner room** – With as few outside walls, windows, and openings as possible. Sit in an inner corner below the window line and not facing the door. Kitchens, bathrooms, or toilets cannot be used as an inner room.

## Outdoors

- **In a built-up area** – Enter a shelter or a stairwell in a nearby building. Stay away from the entrance area.
- **In an open area** – Lie on the ground and protect your head with your hands. When a rocket hits the ground, the explosion blast wave generates fragments that can injure anyone standing up or sitting down.

## Private Transportation


- **Stop by the side of the road**, exit the vehicle, and enter a shelter or a stairwell of a nearby building.

- If you are unable to reach a building within the time available to reach shelter – exit the vehicle and move away from it by the side of the road or the separation fence, lie on the ground, and protect your head with your hands.

- Only if you are unable to leave the vehicle, stop at the side of the road and bend below the window line.

## Public Transport

- **On an intercity bus and student transportation** - The driver should stop the vehicle at the side of the road and open the doors. Passengers must bend below the window line and protect their heads with their hands.

- **On a city bus** - The driver must stop on the side of the road and open the doors for passengers to get off and enter a nearby building. If it is not possible to reach a building within the time available to reach shelter, bend below the window line and protect your head with your hands.

- **When traveling by train** - The driver must slow down to a speed of 30 km/h for 10 minutes. Passengers must bend below the window line in the carriages and protect their heads with their hands.
